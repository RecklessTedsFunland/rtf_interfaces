## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RecklessTedsFunland/rtf_interfaces.git
colcon build --packages-select rtf_interfaces
. install/setup.bash
```

Double check it worked:

```bash
>>> ros2 interface show rtf_interfaces/msg/ImageIR
std_msgs/Header header  # Header timestamp should be acquisition time of image
                        # Header frame_id should be optical frame of camera
                        # origin of frame should be optical center of camera
                        # +x should point to the right in the image
                        # +y should point down in the image
                        # +z should point into to plane of the image
                        # If the frame_id here and the frame_id of the CameraInfo
                        # message associated with the image conflict
                        # the behavior is undefined

uint16 height # rows
uint16 width  # columns

float32[] data # actual matrix data, size is (height * width)
```

# Crap

While best practice is to declare interfaces in dedicated interface packages, sometimes it can be convenient to declare, create and use an interface all in one package.

Recall that interfaces can currently **only be defined in CMake packages**. It is possible, however, to have Python libraries and nodes in CMake packages (using `ament_cmake_python`), so you could define interfaces and Python nodes together in one package. Weâ€™ll use a CMake package and C++ nodes here for the sake of simplicity.
